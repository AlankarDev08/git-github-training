Use case: 1

   First User activities: 
   ======================
   [github.com] Create a remote repository in github.com [User should have github account]
   
   [local machine] Init local repo
   [local machine] Link local repo with remote repository
   
   echo "# second-repo" >> README.md
   git init
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/github06022021/handson-basic.git
   git push -u origin main

   ============================
   Second user activities
   - Cloning and modfication of a file , then push to repo repo.
   ============================
     
   84  mkdir second_user
   85  cd second_user/
   87  git clone https://github.com/github06022021/handson-basic.git
   89  cd handson-basic/

   93  git status
   94  git add README.md 
       git add . [for all files] 
   95  git commit  -m "Feature 2 impl"
   96  git push -u origin main
   
Use case: 3   
   ============================   ============================   ============================
   First User activities after second user pushed the changes
   <change directory to local repo> 
   Eg: /home/labsuser/handson-basic [It is a first user git repo in local machine]
   ============================   ============================   ============================
   $ cat README.md
      First configuration
      Second
   
   $ git pull  [it downloads all the remote changes to the local system.]

Use case: 4
===============================
Create a feature branch via Github.com [Switch branch/Tags]

Second User wants to start work on some feature.
$ git branch -r [lsit down all remote branches]
  output>>> 
    Feature-1
    main
$ git checkout <branch name>.  [download the codebase of that branch/ switch to that branch]
  Eg:  git checkout Feature-1

$ git branch
  output>> 
    *Feature-1.  [current working branch]
    main
$ vi README.md
$ add README.md 
$ git commit  -m "Feature 1 impl "
$ git push -u origin Feature-1     

Branch "Feature-1" is ahead of "main" branch. So we need to merge into "main" branch

Use case: 5
===========
Merge the Feature branch into anthoer branch/ main branch
User should be changed to branch in which merging is required.

$ git checkout main
$ git merge <Source branch which is going to be merged>
  Eg:
   git merge Feature-1 [locally merge Feature-1 branch into main branch]
$ git puch -u origin main  [it updated "main" branch with Feature branch changes]
